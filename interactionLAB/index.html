  I have tons of photos (about 18,000) on my phone which sometimes is extremely hard to find an old picture I took long time ago. I usually group those photos by events, time, places and categories; organizing relevant or selected photos and video in different files will be less time-consuming on finding things. Know how to organize other things like create different calendars for different purpose is also very necessary.
