    <!-- <h2>Let's play with the thickness of this underline</h2> -->
 <p>In making for ourselves a place to live, we first spread a parasol to throw a shadow on the earth, and in the pale light of the shadow we put together a house. There are of course roofs on Western houses too, but they are less to keep off the sun than to keep off the wind and the dew; even from without it is apparent that they are built to create as few shadows as possible and to expose the interior to as much light as possible. <a href="#" class="underlined underlined--thick"> If the roof of a Japanese house is a parasol, the roof of a Western house is no more than a cap, </a> with as small a visor as possible so as to allow the sunlight to penetrate directly beneath the eaves.</p>
